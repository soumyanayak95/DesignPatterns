To show the usage of Abstract Factory pattern, I will create a vending machine implementation.

Input:
A user will choose the type of product he wishes from the vending machine. He can also choose to add instruction
for some product or else will be provided the default preparation.

Expected output:
The user will get the expected product from the vending machine.

Scenario 1:
step 1: User chooses coffee.
step 2: then he selects the type of coffee
step 3: he adds instructions provided to him or can opt for default preparation
step 4: final cost will be calculated based on his choices
step 5: he will get his product
